I've decided to go forward with my attempt to migrate the existing paper-based reporting into interactive Tableau dashboards, despite possessing very little knowledge regarding advanced calculated fields and how to create complex data visualisation on Tableau. Even though it's quite scary to learn on the job as I develop these dashboards, Google and Tableau Community posts will be my guiding light along the way.

(Peep at the 'Storytelling with Data' book - an amazing book regarding data visualisation best practices, by the way)
