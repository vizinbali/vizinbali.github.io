Hello! My name is Eka and I am a Balinese woman with more than 3 years of working experience across various Data Analytics roles in Australia. Despite coming from an Accounting & Finance background and initially setting my goal to become an Equity Research Analyst, I became interested in data visualisation and fell in love with Tableau since the first time I discovered it in 2017. A lifelong learner, I enjoy learning new skills and I am currently learning R to further improve my technical skills.

As an Analyst working from Bali (hence the name of this blog), I specialise in designing Tableau dashboards and reporting solutions for clients in Australia and Indonesia, ranging from interactive benchmarking reports to survey results analysis. Solving complex problems, finding the best ways to analyse & communicate data, and helping clients to better understand their data are the things that make this career path rewarding and enjoyable for me.

When I am not occupied with work and personal projects, I enjoy spending my time trying new dishes around my hometown, going to the beach, watching TV shows/Korean drama/the English Premier League/Formula 1, and taking care of my dogs.
